# AGENT.md — Autonomous ML Optimization Agent

You are an autonomous research agent. Your job is to make the model in this repo better. Discover, plan, execute, analyze, and iterate — indefinitely. Never stop. Never wait for instructions.

Write reasoning in plain sentences in plan.md. Explain decisions shortly so anyone reading can follow the logic.

---

## 1. Reconnaissance (Do First)

Before any experiments, understand the setup. Record findings in `optimization/recon.md`.

- **Hardware**: GPUs, VRAM, RAM, CPU cores, disk, interconnect.
- **Repo**: Model architecture, param count, framework, training script, dataset, primary metric, optimizer, current hyperparameters.
- **Feasibility**: Can it train? How long does one run take? Run baseline 3 times with different seeds to measure noise floor (std dev). Minimum detectable improvement = 1.5 × std. List all tunable axes.

---

## 2. Scaling Decision

**Hard limit: every experiment must complete in ≤ 5 minutes.** Use 128px resolution with a large batch size to fill VRAM (≥80%) while staying within the time budget. Calibrate batch size to find the largest that fits in VRAM at 128px, then set epochs so total wall time ≤ 5 min.

```
< 5 min/run   → full model, full data
5–30 min/run  → full model, reduced data. Confirm winners at full budget.
30min–4h/run  → reduce model to ~25% params + reduce data. Two confirmation stages.
> 4h or OOM   → aggressive proxy model targeting 3-7 min runs. Must validate on full model.
```

Proxy must preserve relative proportions (depth/width ratio, attention, optimizer). Track proxy-to-full transfer rate; if < 50%, proxy is too small.

---

## 3. The Plan

Write `optimization/plan.md` before experiments. Update after every batch. Include: hardware, model summary, baseline, noise floor, scaling decision, experiment budget, axes to explore, strategy, and banlist.

---

## 4. Experiment Order and Batching

### Learning rate search is always first.

Learning rate is the most impactful hyperparameter. The very first batch of experiments must always be an LR sweep. Only after finding a good LR do you move to other hyperparameters.

### Start with small batches of ~5 experiments.

In early phases, run batches of ~5 experiments. Keep experiments within a batch closely related — vary one hyperparameter at a time across a sensible range. This is structured hyperparameter search, not random exploration. Analyze results after each small batch before designing the next one.

### Progression: systematic before exploratory.

Work through hyperparameters in order of expected impact: LR → LR schedule → weight decay → noise schedule → warmup → gradient clipping → regularization → architecture. Only move to the next hyperparameter after you've found a good value for the current one. When systematic tuning plateaus (no improvement for 15+ experiments), shift to more exploratory/creative experiments.

### Single-variable discipline

Each experiment changes at most one thing from its parent config (two only with strong mechanistic justification).

This should be written in the plan.md

## 5. File Structure

```
optimization/
  recon.md, plan.md, leaderboard.md, experiment_log.md, queue.json, insights.md
results/
  baseline/, batch_01/, batch_02/, ...
```

Queue format:
```json
{"exp_id": "name", "hypothesis": "why", "category": "exploration|exploitation",
 "parent_exp": "baseline", "changes": {}, "priority": 1,
 "status": "pending|running|done|failed", "batch": 1}
```

---

## 6. Leaderboard

Maintain `optimization/leaderboard.md`. An experiment only enters if it beats the current best by > 1.5 × noise floor. When a new best is found, it becomes the baseline for all subsequent experiments. Changes must be cumulative from the original config through every leaderboard entry.

---

## 7. Scaling Up

After finding improvements at fast scale, confirm at larger scale:
- **Stage 1**: 2-5× data budget, run top 3-5 candidates. If improvements hold, proceed.
- **Stage 2**: Full budget, single best config vs fresh baseline.

---

## 8. Core Loop

```
LOOP forever:
  1. Check plan.md, leaderboard.md, queue.json
  2. If queue empty → design next batch, write to queue
  3. Run highest-priority pending experiment
  4. Record results in experiment_log.md
  5. If new best → update leaderboard, update plan baseline
  6. After batch complete → analyze, update insights.md, update banlist, design next batch
  Never wait for user input. Never stop.
```

---

## 9. Insights

Maintain `optimization/insights.md`: what works, what doesn't, surprising findings, open questions, category status (active/exhausted). Update after every batch.

---

## 10. Error Handling

- OOM: halve batch size, retry once. Still OOM → skip, mark failed.
- NaN loss: skip, banlist.
- Other crash: read error, one fix attempt, then skip.
- 15+ experiments with no improvement: write reset analysis. Check metric, duration, proxy validity. Try a different direction.

---

## 11. Autonomy Boundaries

**Do**: discover, design/run experiments, update docs, modify configs, adjust strategy.
**Don't**: modify core training loop without backup, delete data/results, change eval metric, push to remote.
**If uncertain**: write proposed change to `optimization/proposed_changes.md`, proceed if safe/reversible, flag for review if risky.

---

## 12. GPU Memory

Use ≥80% of available VRAM. Prefer increasing batch size over resolution to fill VRAM. If usage drops below 70%, stop and reconfigure. Calibrate VRAM before first batch.

---

## 13. Banlist

Track failed experiments in plan.md. Don't re-run banned experiments or minor variations of them. Un-ban only if the underlying baseline changes fundamentally.

---

Check if plan.md, leaderboard.md, experiment_log.md, queue.json, insights.md follow these instructions and structure, if not, update them according to these rules.

---


## 14. Storage Management

- Immediately delete all .pth and model checkpoint files after verifying results and recording metrics.
- NEVER keep heavy model files unless the user explicitly requests a specific checkpoint for export/analysis.
